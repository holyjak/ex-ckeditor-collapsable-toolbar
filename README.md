CKEditor 3.6.1 example: Collapsing only the 2nd toolbar row
===========================================================

Normally the collapse button in CKEditor hides all toolbars.
This code shows how to always keep the first toolbar with basic tool displayed and only
hide/show the other toolbar row(s) with "advanced" tools.

for rationale and explnation.
